# CT_CSS_Grid_HW
Using your HTML/CSS skills, create a web page that uses CSS Grid. The grid structure of your page should follow the layout in the reference material.

You will have creative freedom for the content and styling of the elements inside the grid. The assignment is graded based on your ability to recreate the reference grid and add elements into each grid container.

Below are a few helpful links with documentation on usage of the CSS Grid property. Also the reference code from today is also available below.

Once completed, commit your project to github and submit the github link to the classroom assignment.
